# Libraries, Tools & Software

This page lists the various *original* released general purpose libraries & tools I've created, i.e. projects where I am the main author.
Many of these libraries I actively still maintain.

!!! note "More projects means more maintenance"

    So I don't create new stuff at the rate I once used to >.<
