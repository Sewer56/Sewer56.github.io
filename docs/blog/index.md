# Blog

!!! tip "Happy New 2025!"

I'm going to use this place as a way to share progress regarding my projects, including
[Reloaded3] and other related work.  

Due to how busy I am, I'm not sure how often I'll be able to write here, as there's just too
much work to do for a single person, but I'll try to post something from time to time.  

## Why Run a Blog?

It's simple; I've learned a bunch from reading other people's Blogs, so I want to pass the
knowledge on to the people in the future. ðŸ¤ž
